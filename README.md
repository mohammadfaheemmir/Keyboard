# Keyboard
This Virtual Keyboard project simulates a keyboard interface, allowing users to interact and type directly on the screen. It's ideal for applications where an on-screen keyboard is needed, such as touch devices, games, or custom typing applications. The keyboard features responsive keys that simulate real keystrokes.
